This course presents a gentle introduction to the concepts of Data analysis. The course aims to give an understanding of the data ecosystem and help to differentiate between the roles of a Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Data Engineer.

In this lesson, you will learn about the different types of data structures, file formats, sources of data, and the languages data professionals use in their day-to-day tasks. You will gain an understanding of various types of data repositories such as Databases, Data Warehouses, Data Marts, Data Lakes, and Data Pipelines. In addition, you will learn about the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Process, which is used to extract, transform, and load data into data repositories. 

By the end of this lesson, you will:

Describe and differentiate between relational and non-relational database management systems

Explain the key use cases of Apache Spark
Databases

# Databases
By now, you are aware of the fact that data gets stored in databases. There are two types of databases where the data can be stored: Relational databases (RDBMS) and non-relational databases. Let's see the basic difference both of these:
